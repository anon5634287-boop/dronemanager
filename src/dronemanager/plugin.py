""" Class for extra, loadable plugins.

Plugins extend the functionality of DroneManager or Drone Classes by providing extra functions. They can also register
their own commands to the CLI.

    The attribute cli_commands is called by the DroneManager CLI (and could be called by other UIs) to populate their
    interfaces. This is a dictionary with coroutines as values and human-readable names as keys. In DroneManager
    the names are used together with the class prefix to determine the command input on the command line, while the
    signature of the function is used to populate the CLI parser.
    The attribute background_functions should list coroutines that will run indefinitely, for example those
    polling for status updates from a camera. They will be started during construction of the class object, usually
    when the module is loaded. Note that these must be coroutines.

    A common kwarg is "name", for plugins of which multiple copies may be loaded, in which case the name acts as the
    unique identifier.
