Holodeck
--------

Holodeck is an example for the integration of DroneManager with modern simulation environments like Unity. It allows Users to control a real (or simulated) drone with a Playstation Controller via DroneManager while experiencing the virtual flight in a Unity Environment with enhanced perception through VR-Glasses (e.g. Meta-Quest Pro).

See the :doc:`Holodeck documentation <holodeck>` for more information.
